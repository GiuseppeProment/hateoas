##How to compile and run the application with an example for each call.

**mvn spring-boot:run** 

The application is HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) compliant.

urls:

###Create product
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{  \"name\" : \"banana\",  \"description\" : \"fruta\" }" http://localhost:8080/products

*result*

HTTP/1.1 201
 
Location: http://localhost:8080/products/4

...
###Update product
curl -i -X PATCH -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{  \"description\" : \"fruta tropical\" }" http://localhost:8080/products/4

*result*

HTTP/1.1 200
 
...
###Delete product
curl -i -X DELETE -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8080/products/4

##Scenario
Scenario:

We have a Product Entity with One to Many relationship with Image entity

Product also has a Many to One relationship with itself (Many Products to one Parent Product) 

1ยบ Build a Restful service using JAX-RS to perform CRUD operations on a Product resource using Image as a sub-resource of Product.

2ยบ Your API classes should perform these operations:

* x1) Create, update and delete products
* x2) Create, update and delete images
* x3) Get all products excluding relationships (child products, images) 
* x4) Get all products including specified relationships (child product and/or images) 
* x5) Same as 3 using specific product identity 
* x6) Same as 4 using specific product identity 
* x7) Get set of child products for specific product 
* x8) Get set of images for specific product


3ยบ Build JPA/Hibernate classes using annotations to persist these objects in the database 

Technical Specification:

1) Maven must be used to build, run tests and start the application.
2) The tests must be started with the mvn test command.
3) The application must start with a Maven command: mvn exec:java, mvn jetty:run, mvn spring-boot:run, etc.
4) The application must have a stateless API and use a database to store data.
5) An embedded in-memory database should be used: either H2, HSQL, SQLite or Derby.
6) The database and tables creation should be done by Maven or by the application.
7) You must provide BitBucket username. A free BitBucket account can be created at http://bitbucket.org. Once finished, you must give the user ac-recruitment read permission on your repository so that you can be evaluated. 
8) You must provide a README.txt (plain text) or a README.md (Markdown) file at the root of your repository, explaining:
- How to compile and run the application with an example for each call.
- How to run the suite of automated tests.
- Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.
